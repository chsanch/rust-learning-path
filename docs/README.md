# Workspace Documentation (docs)

Welcome. This `docs` folder contains the versioned documentation for the workspace. Here we centralize:

 - Learning plan and notes by topic and project.
 - Links to code within this repo (e.g., `apps/...`).
 - Checklists and next steps.

Suggested index:
- `Projects/grep-lite.md` — first CLI project.
- `Templates/Project.md` — template for new projects.

Tip: open this repo as an Obsidian Vault to edit these notes. If you prefer to keep notes outside the repo, see `AGENTS.md` (symlink or submodule options).
